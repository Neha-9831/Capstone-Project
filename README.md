Understanding Customer Behavvior with Customer Segmentation Methods

“Customer Personality Analysis” 
Helping businesses to better understand their customers and making it easier for them to modify offers according to the specific needs, behaviours and concerns of different types of customers by doing Customer Personality Analysis.
Whereas, in carrying out successful E-commerce, the most important things are innovation and understanding what customers want. The aim of the project is to help the E-commerce business platforms to segment its customers based on RFM Model using Machine Learning Techniques. The Customers are segmented into High (group who buys often, spends more and visits the platform recently), Medium (group which spends less than high group and is not that much frequent to visit the platform) and lastly Low (group which is on the verge of churning out). This idea can be implemented by the B2C Companies to outperform the competition by reaching potential customers.
